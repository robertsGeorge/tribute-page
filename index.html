      <h2>Selected career milestones</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on 22 August 1862 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Seine-et-Oise, on the north-west fringes of Paris</li>
        <li><strong>In 1872</strong>, aged ten, he was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he remained a student for the next eleven years</li>
        <li> Debussy won France's most prestigious musical award, the Prix de Rome, with his cantata L'enfant prodigue</li>
        <li><strong>In June 1885</strong> Debussy wrote of his desire to follow his own way, saying, "I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!"</li>
        <li><strong>In 1887</strong> Debussy heard the first act of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde at the Concerts Lamoureux, and judged it "decidedly the finest thing I know"</li>
        <li><strong>In 1889</strong> at the Paris Exposition Universelle, Debussy first heard Javanese gamelan music. The gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, and ensemble textures appealed to him, and echoes of them are heard in "Pagodes" in his piano suite Estampes</li>
        <li><strong>In 1890</strong> Debussy met Erik Satie, who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition. Both were bohemians, enjoying the same caf√© society and struggling to stay afloat financially</li>
      </ul>
